### The Math Module

Answer each of the following questions in the same Python file named `hw6-3.py`. In your heading, put your name and the date you began working on the file. You will need the `math` module for this assignment so be sure to import it at the beginning of your file.

Each question should consist of 2 lines. The first line should be a comment with `Question #` where the `#` is the number of the question. The next line should print the use of a function of the module that completes the desired task.

*Example*

``` python
# Question 0
your answer to the question

1. Write a line of code that returns square root of `529`.

2. Write a line of code that returns the sine of `0`.

3. Write a line of code that returns the cosine of `2 pi`.

4. Write a line of code that returns 2.5 raised to the power of `5`.

5. Write a line of code that returns the natural log of `e`.

6. Write a line of code that returns e raised to the power of `4`.

7. Write a line of code that returns the ceiling of `-12.9`.

8. Write a line of code that returns the floor of `7.25`.
